# LebwohlLasherAssessment

Project files of assessment 1 of Core Computing 2024 on speeding up a program following the Lebwohl Lasher model.

testFig1Init and 2 and 3 are the results of running the input values 1000 20 1 and then 1,2 or 3. These are different visual outputs with very insignificant time differences however their plotting can be skipped entirely for speed comparisons.

testFig1Fin and 2 and 3 show the final time shot of the output after as shown in the command line 1000 time steps.
